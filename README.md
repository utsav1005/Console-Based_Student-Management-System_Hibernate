# Console-Based_Student-Management-System_Hibernate
A menu-driven console application built using Core Java and Hibernate ORM that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records with database persistence.
This project demonstrates how Hibernate can be integrated into a non-web (console) application to manage relational data efficiently.

🚀 Features

• Add, view, update, and delete student records

• Menu-driven console interaction using Scanner

• Database persistence using Hibernate ORM

• XML-based Hibernate configuration (hibernate.cfg.xml)

• Mapping using Hibernate mapping files using annotations

• Proper session and transaction management

• Clean layered architecture (Entity, DAO, Service, Console UI)

🛠 Tech Stack

• Java (Core Java)

• OOP Concepts

• Collections Framework (ArrayList)

• Scanner (Console Input)

📌 Core Functionalities

Create – Add student details such as ID, name, and age

Read – Display all stored student records

Update – Modify existing student data using ID

Delete – Remove student records from the system

🧠 What I Learned

• Implementing CRUD operations without frameworks

• Applying OOP principles such as encapsulation and abstraction

• Using Java collections to manage data

• Building menu-driven console applications

• Structuring code for maintainability

🔮 Future Enhancements

• Integrate database using JDBC or Hibernate

• Convert to Spring or Spring Boot

• Add role-based access (Admin/User)
